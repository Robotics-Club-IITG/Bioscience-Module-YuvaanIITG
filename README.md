Classifying soil texture is based on soil grain size, such as gravel, silt, sand, etc. This is a rather simple way of classifying soil because there are firm cutoffs between each classification. For example, gravel is any grain over 2 mm in diameter, sand is between  116  mm to 2 mm, and silt/clay is smaller than  116  mm.

## Data Augmentation
Data Augmentation is a practice that is commonly used in image classification that enlarges the existing image dataset by creating new data sets from the existing data. This augmentation is most commonly seen in operations like shifting the image, mirroring the image horizontally or vertically, zooming in on the image, and so on. These augmentations then create new images and thus enhance the number of images to train on. Read more about this in an article from Jason Brownlee.

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a popular model for image classification. CNNs distinguish characteristics of an image by looping through the pixel values in an image and calculating the dot product of a those pixels with a filter kernel matrix. These kernel matrices accentuate different aspects of the image such as vertical and horizontal lines, curvature, etc. For more information on CNNs, see APMonitor - Computer Vision with Deep Learning.
